# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Dr.Ruben is a engineer who is currently constructing a house in Japan he is interested in getting a website to track the construction of his new house. Originally he has been taking a photo after every build session then writing a paragraph about the improvements or the materials need for another part of the house, however this is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Dr. Ruben to find the specfic date of the photo along and keep track of how each project within the house is going. Dr.Ruben is in need of a website that helps him track the construction and materials of his soon to be home. 


## Design statement:
I will to design websiter for a client who is trying to track construction of his house. The website will hold currency and is constructed using the software pyhton/flask. It will be evaluated according to the criteria (please check succes critera 1-6).

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
I chose Python because itâ€™s one of the most user-friendly programming languages that is quickly growing globally. [1] According to Linked In, python is easy to understand because of its simple English syntax that allows the programmer to create programs easily.[2] Python also has access to numerous libraries that allow developers to program more efficiently. These libraries provide an API (application programming interface) which makes it easy for developers to use them with their own software programs.[3] Furthermore, Pythons is versatile language that can be used for web development, software development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.[4] Thats why I believe Python will be able to solve all of my client's problems and let her have a functioning crypto wallet.



## Success Criteria
1. The website has a user-friendly interface that allows Dr. Ruben to upload photos and descriptions easily after each build session.
2. The website automatically timestamps each photo and description to keep track of the specific dates and times of updates.
3. The website includes a project management feature that organizes and categorizes updates by different parts of the house or specific projects.
4. The website allows Dr. Ruben to track the materials needed for each part of the house, including quantities and costs from amazon?
5. The website provides a search and filter function to help Dr. Ruben quickly find specific updates or materials information by date, project, or keyword.
6. The website includes a dashboard that visually displays the progress of the construction, highlighting completed tasks, ongoing projects, and upcoming material needs.
